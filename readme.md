# Sortingvisualizer

I did this project on my own time at the start of the first year of school to learn more about javascript.

It generates array of pillars of different length and then uses quicksort algorithm to sort them.

The arrays and visuals were made completely by me and quicksort was made with help of documentation of how that algorithm worked.

# What I learned

This was first time for me to handle algorithm and I think quicksort was a good beginner frendly algorithm and also I learned about asynchronous functions in js.
